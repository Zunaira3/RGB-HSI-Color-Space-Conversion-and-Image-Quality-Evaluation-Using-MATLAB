# RGB-HSI-Color-Space-Conversion-and-Image-Quality-Evaluation-Using-MATLAB
his project applies image processing techniques in MATLAB using RGB and HSI color spaces. It includes channel separation, smoothing filters, intensity-channel filtering in HSI, and quality evaluation using MSE and PSNR to compare reconstruction quality and the effect of filter size and color space.
